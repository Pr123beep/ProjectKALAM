At AarogyaID, we’re solving a problem that has caused frustration for years in the healthcare insurance industry. Insurance claims are complicated and slow, with insurers spending too much time collecting all documents filled with complex and varied data, which are then manually entered into software for adjudication, a process that demands significant time and effort. Additional steps, such as doctor validations for anomalies or high-value claims, further slow down the workflow. Imagine an employee spending hours chasing providers for documents, verifying mismatched templates, and manually entering data into outdated systems. Delays pile up, approvals become unclear, and frustration builds as insurers struggle to meet KPIs while keeping costs under control. Post-approval, transparency issues with claim amounts often lead to disputes, reprocessing, and grievances from both providers and patients. On top of all this insurers/TPA face high fraud rates of claims, especially in OPD insurance claims.

These delays leave providers and patients waiting, often confused about what’s covered or approved. This lack of clarity leads to disputes, lost trust, and wasted effort.

We believe it shouldn’t be this hard. Our platform simplifies the entire process by automating and streamlining every step, cutting out delays, reducing costs, and ensuring transparency at every level. This means faster results for insurers, better experiences for providers, and confidence for patients. It’s a smarter, easier way to handle claims and solve a problem the industry can’t afford to ignore any longer.

Join us in transforming the OPD insurance landscape. At AarogyaID, we are committed to delivering seamless, transparent, and efficient claims processing, ensuring better outcomes and a superior healthcare experience for all stakeholders.

I founded AIndra Systems, a Startup creating products in the area of Computer Vision, a domain under Artificial Intelligence. 

Aindra's Vision is to create products that have a deep impact on the society and believes that this vision can be achieved by the use of Artificially Intelligent technology. The idea for the startup came when I was asked to find a solution to the problem of subsidy leakage in Govt sanctioned schemes for the rural school-going children. 

Aindra is now leveraging the AI platform that we built and are building products in the extremely cutting edge domain of 'Computational Pathology'. We are working on developing a Point-of-Care cancer detection platform that has, as its heart, an Artificial Intelligence engine. We believe technology can democratise healthcare in India and other developing countries.

I was chosen as a delegate of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit held in San Francisco in 2016 organised by the US govt. I was selected by State of Karnataka to represent the startup community at BioKorea in 2016 and also one of the 5 startup founders selected by Dept of Biotechnology to visit Cambridge UK in 2016. 

I am active in the Startup ecosystem in Bangalore and meet Entrepreneurs regularly and help in organizing meetups and events centered around startups. I have been a Program Leader for the Startup Leadership Program, a global Entrepreneurship program.

At Aindra Systems, I take care of Market sensing, Opportunity sizing, Product Management, Business Development and Sales. I am ably supported by a young and enthusiastic team and mentored by some extremely sharp veterans. 

Specialties':
* Market Sensing
* Opportunity Sizing
* Lean Methodologies

Aindra is currently being supported by Villgro, Dept of Biotechnology, US-India Science and Technology Endowment, and the Millennium Alliance. We work closely with multiple top technology institutes around the country like the Indian Institute of Science, IIT Madras, and IIT Mandi.

Currently healthcare is reactive, need to align incentives for folks to be actively interested in more regular health checkups, and package it in form of OPD + health insurance

Initial approach: Start with a health locker, capture users data at source with minimal friction, give insights to them on top of it
Issues: It would take a long time to get the level of data where insurance companies are interested, so incentives would need to be our burn 

Pivotal insight: This should be doctor led, as opposed to patient led. Align doctors economic incentives to keep the patient connected, and data access can be second order effect. 
Chronic diseases are where doctor makes money, they lose out on potential revenue as most patients recommended by doctors for routine checkups or medicine reigmen, churn after a certain time period, thus leading to potential revenue loss. 

Pivot: build an engagement engine for doctors to keep their patients engaged, and in touch, reduce churn 

Initial research: Done

Next? Closed it off: Didn't put enough time on refining our thesis, and approach. DIdn't spent enough time on it. Conviction was not there in team, we disbanded.

In fact, it was the Inter-School Science Competition held in 2008 in which a number of schools from across New Delhi participated. This helped me rekindle the ambition of becoming Robotics stalwart. The deadline of a mere 2 weeks time and a meager thousand rupees (20 US dollars approx) at my disposal was playing on mind heavily but we had no choice.Failures in the form of not coming out with the desired model and hence the task seemed to be an uphill one.We persevered by trying different techniques and combinations. As the time went by and the time was drawing near I realized that I had it in me already and that the final stage of task was accomplished easily. Finally when the robot car was rolled out I realized the importance of perseverance. It is worth mentioning here that the feat was accomplished by using most of junk parts viz old aluminum name plates for the base, photo wooden frames for the body, disused wires for circuit connection, the parts of an obsolete computer printer viz socket/plug unit -- all from the School Junk Yard and thus had incurred a meager amount. This Competition not only acted as a platform to exhibit my skills but also enabled me to hone my organizational and planning skills. Later, this event also inspired me so much that whenever I self-doubt creeps in my mind, I recollect the achievement and derive confidence and overcome the apprehensions/obstacles.

This is Kirkus Review's summary of JOURNEY OF THE MIND, the general audience neuroscience book I have been working on for the last few years. It is out in stores on March 8th, 2022.

https://bit.ly/JourneyoftheMind

I am also working on Giffie, a product in the early education space. It is at the interesection of AI, neuroscience, and learning -- three intertwined topics that are dear to my heart.

2012-2020:
I am the founder of Kernel Insights. This journey started when I happened to build a technology product (MakkhiChoose) while working on a non-fiction book (A Billion Wicked Thoughts). MakkhiChoose took off. After getting to the first 10K users ,I decided to get serious and build a team. Hired the first two, and then all subsequent team members, by crafting specific programming and data-related challenges and advertising them nationally on Facebook (back when it was still cheap). Got quite a few things wrong over the last couple of years, but one we got right is hiring, and I am super proud of the way we did this (http://puzzles.makkhichoose.com/unscramble). We've built several revenue generating products along the way, and scaled some to a few lakh users (that's 100,000 for non-Indians). 

After an undergrad in engineering (IIT Madras), I went to grad school (Boston University) to study computational neuroscience. I did this after being profoundly inspired by Dr. V.S. Ramachandran's book, Phantoms in the Brain. Two decades later, the world has woken up to promise of biologically inspired neural networks in pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. 

Data, and a deep understanding of it, will change our world (for the better).

Here is a snippet:

As the Co-Founder of CtrlAltHeal, I am applying my academic knowledge in the scientific principles of Ayurveda, my nearly two decades of experience in building customizable and scalable health-tech products, and my understanding of creating a tech roadmap for developing an integrative wellness platform.

What do I plan to achieve by doing so?

1.⁠ ⁠As a core believer that becoming a “better you” requires care adherence, we have created extensive care protocols that cover the entire spectrum of wellness – nutrition, fitness, therapies, and continual monitoring of mind, body, and energy. 
2.⁠ ⁠To scale, one needs to have an agile mindset and a clear blueprint. I have tapped into my experiences as a Product Leader in various corporations and wellness institutions to build this model for my company. 
3.⁠ ⁠I also believe that one cannot exist nor perform “alone.” To deliver a care continuum, the ecosystem of healthcare practitioners - including doctors, specialists, diagnostics, pharmacies, and wellness specialists - needs to work together. We are one of the fastest-growing wellness partner networks in India.

My career has been driven by the need to offer preventive wisdom and management treatments to all those who believe in the power of nature facilitated by technology. By combining diagnostics with Indian sciences such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Nutrition, Panchkarma, Naturopathy, and Energy systems, my global patients have benefited immensely. 

I am sought after for my areas of expertise, which include:

•⁠ ⁠The ability to integrate ancient holistic science principles with contemporary care interventions by the dynamics of current lifestyles.
•⁠ ⁠Guiding, monitoring, and supporting patients through their wellness journeys.
•⁠ ⁠Strategic business development for driving preventive/wellness/fitness services and products.
•⁠ ⁠Achieving a 90% success rate in managing cases of PCOD, PID, Diabetes, and Obesity.

→ I have been in b2b sales for over 15 years and I always wished there was a way out for the scenario below


# I just wrapped a demo with a prospect and sent my proposal in an email. 
# Now I will follow up until I get a yes/no. 
# I meet my numbers IF I get to my prospect and IF they give me an answer.
# I am unsure if I should focus on new pipeline or if my existing is solid enough 
# By the time I realize that the prospect is not interested, my month is already over and there’s no time left for new prospects.
# Next month, I say goodbye to my stale pipeline and start the cycle all over again. 

Shouldn't there be a smarter way to do this?

→NOW PICTURE THIS 

# Before I hop on that demo, I get the professional background & personality type of my prospect in seconds without having to search multiple sites.
# I now know if this prospect fits my ICP profile and his/her unique personality type as a buyer.
# I wrap my demo and within minutes I send over a hyper personalized pitch that matches the prospects business and personality type.
# My proposal keeps me informed on when and how many times my proposal is being viewed, who else it invited to view etc.
# When it comes to follow ups, I know exactly when they are available and I can engage them directly on my proposal.
# Out of the 50 prospects I spoke with this month, I know which of them are the most active and the highest intent to buy.

I started writing code during my second grade at school. Now, I am a jack of all trades in software product development. A programming language agnostic. One-liner ""Product Guy"".

My coding journey started with Microsoft Quick Basic in my second grade at school. During my fourth grade, I picked up HTML, CSS, Flash and ActionScript. My interest in music led to my first blog to share my musical compositions in sixth grade. The same year I started building software with VB6 and MS Access, later advancing to VB.NET-MSSQL and PHP-MYSQL.

It was my win for building AIO Suite (Virtual Operating System) in VB.NET at Prodigy 2010, an annual event for high school students by the College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai. Later developed the AIO Suite as a cloud-based virtual desktop in C#.NET again but for Prodigy 2012. Later that year, I bought my first domain 5inetune.com and then managed some tech blogs, youtube channels and exited them with some success - thegeekin, inets, geeksplunk.

In 2011, I won awards for creating a Game Suite and an Operating System on top of openSUSE.

Prodigy 2012 got me more awards for building a website, poster design, microblogging tool using PHP, and a business idea for installing public wifi mesh network.

Later in 2013, I created a full-featured social network. This win made my first startup Tringle - a customer support service tool based on Twitter in NodeJS. Later took it to Startup Asia 2014 in Singapore.

Then in 2015 - 2017, I hit an end with a retail cloud startup WYCE. But it laid the foundations for my next venture. Since then, I have been working on a low-code platform for enterprises. It helps organisations rapidly develop and deploy applications with the best consumer-grade experience for their people and customers. It is stealth under the banner of IO FACTORY, backed by a big name in the AEC space.

According to ILO, more than 2.3mn people lost their lives & about 31.3mn got seriously injured at workplaces in 2017. Fall from working at height, collision with moving machinery and exposure to dangerous chemicals are all examples of common work-site hazards. Hazards such as these can cause serious injuries or even fatalities. In addition, safety incidents also bring the potential for lost work time, higher insurance, and workers' compensation claims, all of which affect a business's bottom line.

This is why practically every organization has an established set of policies and procedures designed to prevent accidents and injuries. Sadly, a lot of hazard mitigation techniques that companies currently adopt are administrative in nature. Administrative controls include employee training, signs and warning labels, and procedure changes. Although administrative controls can be used to control employee exposure, workers are prone to human error and cannot always be relied upon to ensure safety.

By leveraging IoT and AI technologies in our smart personal protective equipment (PPE) products (SAFMET - smart safety helmet & SAFFR HARNESS - smart safety harness to prevent fall) along with other accessories, we help companies to eliminate or/and isolate the hazards. 

Our SAFFR AI solution effectively delivers 'intelligence at the edge' to benefit users with real-time analytics and actionable response. Our technology helps us establish safety baselines by giving us valuable data-points like how close workers were getting to a hazard and ultimately reducing life-threatening events and near-misses.

With our industry 4.0 solutions in safety, which we call as SAFETY 4.0, industry leaders won't just 'believe' their work sites are safe.

As a behavioral marketing consultant, I’ve helped brands decode consumer mindsets, decision-making, and subconscious triggers. But beyond marketing, I’ve always believed there’s something deeper—the way emotions shape not just choices but creativity itself.

That’s what led me to build iblive.ai—an Emotional AI Art Engine that transforms human expression into emotionally relevant art.

Why iblive AI? Because in a hyper-digital world, emotions are getting lost in algorithms. Attention is currency, but expression is identity. I wanted to create something where people don’t just consume art—they become the artist of their own emotions.

My family's deep roots in manufacturing instilled an understanding of customer needs and value creation in me with the value of continuous improvement. My personal values are conscious leadership, collective growth and high integrity.

My curiosity and continuous need to learn led me, an engineer with a first rank and an FBI-sponsored face recognition program under my belt, to pursue an Executive MBA in Leadership from one of the best business schools: Cranfield School of Management.

Having worked within the SAP ERP space for 15+ years at companies like Rolls-Royce and Honeywell and helping 100s Manufacturing companies while at Winshuttle/Precisely, my career became a quest to understand and optimize complex systems. Making complex simple and creating value addition in the market not just on spreadsheets.

As the Founder of Industrility, we transform product-centric industrial companies to become service-centric (even as-a-service); enabled by technologies like IIoT, Digital Twin, AI/ML and Generative AI.

Did you know 90% of customers abandon authorized parts and services after the warranty expires? 
A staggering 75% of lifetime revenue is lost to counterfeit parts and unauthorized or ignored services – a harsh truth for OEMs. McKinsey calls it a gold mine, but for most companies, it's buried deep in complexity.

We've built a team of engineers, data scientists, and business veterans who understand the unique challenges, nuances and opportunities of the industrial world.

Here's how we turn that potential into reality:

•The user-friendly platform seamlessly integrates with existing systems, enabling efficient data collection and analysis for optimized performance.

•We connect equipment manufacturers directly with their customers and assets, fostering personalized interactions that strengthen relationships and drive long-term partnerships.

•Our solutions leverage advanced technologies like TwinGPT (AI co-pilot) and Dynamic Warranty™ to unlock new revenue opportunities and optimize performance, helping industrial manufacturers navigate the Industry 4.0 landscape.

We work exclusively with medium-sized and large-sized Industrial companies to improve their operations and increase revenue, seeing them reclaim their rightful share of the after-sales goldmine fuels my passion every day.

But here we are, 15+ years later, after building and scaling SaaS products in Silicon Valley across 5+ startups, and now, founder of a cybersecurity startup.

Raised in a family of farmers, I soaked in resilience, perseverance, gratitude and most importantly the willingness to make a difference. 

Even though not applied to farming, I attribute these early learnings to most of my professional success. 
After graduating with an engineering degree, I began my career in a renowned hedge fund and then immigrated to the US to work in Silicon Valley startups. 

Since then, I have worked in 4+ Silicon Valley startups, most being seed stage. During the same time, I’ve had the opportunity to watch the Silicon Valley veterans like Jyoti Bansal closely, work with them and learn from their mentorship.

While working with him on a cybersecurity product, I encountered fundamental inefficiencies in the cybersecurity space. 

Inefficiencies in the development, integration and testing of API systems in enterprise applications that culminate in data breaches and PR nightmares. 

Manual pen testing is hardly comprehensive pre-launch, and a lack of documentation makes it virtually impossible. Shockingly, 50% of organizations only test their security during periodic audits, with 18% never testing at all. 

To tackle these problems, I founded Levo.ai. 

Contrary to most solutions in the space that generate and combat alerts when the applications are already live, our approach is preventing attacks through automated testing while the applications are still in development. 

Why? 

The flawed reactive approach takes companies an average of 280 days to identify and contain a breach, costing them a whopping $3.86 million to $6.45 million. (Source: IBM)

Our solution enables robust discovery, documentation and automated testing while your developers work on building the app-a proactive approach that is necessary as cybersecurity threats continue to escalate rapidly. 

Curious about how it works? Feel free to book a demo or reach out to me here on LinkedIn.",9958,Founder at Levo.ai | Helping Enterprises proactively secure their apps and APIs,Apr 2021 - Present,"During our time at Traceable, Harish and I, adopting the Silicon Valley tradition, found inspiration through long lunchtime walks. Customer conversations led to a critical insight: existing solutions addressed threats only after an attack.

With a steep surge in cybersecurity threats, this reactive approach seemed counterproductive. 
And market research affirmed our insights: 

1) 75% of cyber attacks target applications
2) API attacks constitute 83% of web application attacks
3) 50% of organizations only test their security during periodic security audits and 18% never test.

These inefficiencies led to enterprises hiring extensive security teams to resolve ad-hoc security threats generated by the existing solutions. 

Not realizing that the problem began at the very start when their developers were writing code and creating the applications, with next to no documentation for the security teams to check for vulnerabilities. 

The result? 

Applications are shipped with minimal and inefficient manual testing. As a result, threats only widen as applications go live. 

Hence, there is an increased possibility of data thefts, damaged reputation and financial loss. 

Motivated by this vision and drawing on my 10+ years of SaaS experience, I delved into the world of API security. 

With co-founder Harish, our mission was clear: develop a product to test applications during development on an automated basis.

Our vision resonated, and our first fundraising was completed within 12 days, a testament to founder-market fit. 

Despite pandemic challenges, I hired a team of 10 rockstar engineers across the US, Argentina and India. 

After 1.5 years of rigorous development, we have launched our product, pioneering a proactive era for application security.

In the last six months, we've built a multi-million dollar sales pipeline, onboarding several public fintech companies as our clients. In 2023, we closed multi-million dollar deals—all achieved with a lean team of 10.","Austin, Texas Metropolitan Area",Founder & CEO,Dec 2022 - Present,,Angel Investor,,https://linkedin.com/in/buchireddy,https://linkedin.com/school/osmania-university-hyderabad,B.E,"Osmania University, Hyderabad","Coaching, Software as a Service (SaaS), Customer Journey Mapping, Technical Recruiting, Business Development, Team Building, Project Management, Mentoring, Cloud Security, Application Security Architecture, Cybersecurity, Application Security, Leadership, Distributed Systems, Software Development, Design Patterns, Scalability, Data Structures, Debugging, TCP/IP","Austin, Texas Metropolitan Area",Uniblox,,,,,Jul 2004 - Jul 2008,"As I was always at the top of my class in the government school in our village, my uncle noticed that I had academic potential. 

So, with the help of my extended family, I moved to Hyderabad from my village for high school. Being from a South Indian family, science was the only viable subject, especially for an academic child like me. 

Due to financial constraints, pursuing a medical degree was ruled out. However, an interesting conversation with a family friend invoked extreme curiosity about the world of software and code. 

Fueled by this newfound interest and unwavering dedication during exam preparations, I secured admission to one of the premier engineering colleges in my state.

With our SEO strategies, your business grows where it matters most—online.",,"A serial entrepreneur with 12 years of experience, featured in NYT and Forbes, I am a verified personal branding expert, SEO specialist, and digital marketer.

But let's go from the beginning..

I started as a mechanical engineer, dreaming of a stable career.

But life had other plans; it pushed me into content writing, starting with just $100 a month.

From those humble beginnings, I worked my way up, started the company & taking that company to $15,000 per month in recurring revenue.

In between, I founded Write Right, Dad of Ad, Taletel, Estorytellers, and Kalam Kagaz, successfully exiting each one.

The years of experience taught me invaluable lessons in SEO and personal branding, helping me become the best among the best.

Now, I am using these skills to help founders, CEOs, and entrepreneurs do the same.

I didn’t stop—I wrote for Forbes, authored 13+ books, and became known as a top digital marketing and personal branding expert.

And this is why I say -Life is the best teacher",,,"My writing flair and passion sparked during my college days at Marwadi University.

I started small, writing for newsletters, college events, and blogs, finding joy in every word I crafted.

I'm a guy who wears many hats, and I like it that way! 

My marketing journey kicked off at a company where I managed a team of over 25 folks as the Marketing Lead and Operations Manager. 

But my itch for something more took me down the road of content and niche marketing. That's how I ended up co-creating Saleshandy, a place where I'm still enjoying the ride and helping the company grow.

I'm a marketing junkie and a business starter, and I get my kicks from companies that encourage teamwork and don't put up roadblocks to success. I live to meet and exceed what customers want. I keep a close eye on the results and always tinkering with my game plan based on what's needed. When things go south, I don't get bent out of shape; I see it as a chance to learn. I take a good, hard look at what went wrong, figure out why, and then cook up solutions based on the facts.

As a growth hacker and digital marketing buff, I thrive on the hustle and meet life with a never-say-die attitude. My constant grin shows my love for creating strong teams and my readiness to lend a hand at the drop of a hat.

So here I am, a Co-founder at Saleshandy, extending an invitation for you to join me on this wild ride as we take over the marketing world, one success story at a time.

These engagements have unlocked $7+ billion in enterprise value. 

My typical client is a high growth B2B SaaS company, spending $1+ million per year in online lead generation. They have maxed out primary keywords on PPC. They are doing Capterra, Gartner, Forrester etc. (A surprising amount are on the side of Formula One cars).

My clients need to get more traffic to convert, and know the key is taking lots of big swing A/B tests. But, they need help with the following two problems:

(1) What to test. They don't know what tests they should run. They want someone who has done it before and can tell them what is working in their industry. They want a roadmap of the most impactful proven winning tests. 

(2) Testing Resources. They don’t have the dedicated researchers, designers, developers, analysts, CRO’s, and project managers they need to run tests. They want on-tap experienced testing specialists to take insights from whiteboard to live test - fast.

With Spiralyze SaaS Clients get 30% more conversions in 90 days, eCommerce clients get 15% more conversions. Results are guaranteed. Fees start at $25k/month and you don't pay a penny until after we deliver.

With degrees in applied physics and medicine, my journey has been defined by a relentless passion for leveraging science and technology to elevate humanity, inspire growth, and unlock extraordinary potential in individuals and organizations.

While at UCLA during my medical training, I spearheaded groundbreaking research using AI to revolutionize decision-making in healthcare (starting in 1995). By enabling doctors to make smarter, faster, and more cost-effective care choices, we dramatically improved healthcare outcomes. This work inspired me to co-found Corticon in 2000, a rules-based AI software platform that transformed industries from healthcare to finance, retail, and manufacturing. Corticon's success led to its acquisition by Progress (NASDAQ: PRGS) in 2012, where I served as Chief Technologist and General Manager, driving innovative solutions on a global scale.

In 2016, I turned my focus to an audacious goal: extending healthy human lifespans. As co-founder of Elevian, I lead a team of Harvard scientists developing biotherapeutics to repair and regenerate the body, tackling the root causes of aging and degenerative diseases. Together, we aim to redefine what it means to live a long, vibrant life.

Today, I channel my passion for AI and innovation through HeroForge.AI. Our mission? To empower leaders and businesses to thrive in the AI era, unlocking their potential to drive growth, disrupt industries, and shape the future. Through my exclusive HeroForge Mastermind Pro, I coach elite CEOs and business leaders on harnessing AI to dominate the AI Gold Rush, create transformative success, and avoid being left behind.

With over four years of experience under my belt across various testing domains like Functional and Non-Functional Testing as well as Backend API and Mobile Testing, I’ve had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of automation.

At Xebia, where I currently work as a QA Automation Engineer, I implemented test automation frameworks using Java while embracing practices like TDD and hybrid models with tools such as Selenium and TestNG. One of my proudest moments was optimizing our automation runtime by an impressive 50% through parallel processing techniques - this not only improved efficiency but also allowed us to deliver results faster without compromising on quality.

Before this role at Xebia, I spent nearly two years at Persistent Systems where I designed BDD automation frameworks using Cucumber. Creating over 200+ feature files helped reduce manual testing efforts by 70%, which was incredibly rewarding for both me and the team! Each project taught me something new about collaboration and innovation within the tech space.

Outside of work hours you might find me tinkering with new technologies or engaging in local tech meetups - sharing knowledge is something I'm passionate about! It’s amazing how much we can learn from each other when we come together as a community.

The journey involved integrating Test Driven Development (TDD) practices and hybrid models that have significantly enhanced testing efficiency across various projects. One of the proudest achievements was optimizing the automation runtime by an impressive 50% through innovative parallel processing techniques within these frameworks.

The role also emphasized streamlining CI/CD processes by configuring pipelines that integrated automated tests for smoke and regression suites. This effort reduced test execution time by approximately 30%, allowing for rapid feedback loops that benefited development teams immensely. Documenting quality goals while collaborating with stakeholders ensured alignment on deliverables.

Another highlight includes resolving over 50 automation issues across multiple projects which led to a substantial reduction in downtime—by about 20%. This not only enhanced overall team productivity but also improved project delivery timelines significantly. Conducting more than ten knowledge transfer sessions fostered an environment of continuous learning among team members; achieving an impressive adoption rate of around 80% for automation best practices ultimately boosted their efficiency by about 25%. 

Overall, leading R&D efforts to transition from manual to automated testing methods resulted in achieving a remarkable 70% automation rate within the team.

With 14 years of experience and passion for all things architecture, I help mid and large-size real-estate companies and design firms transform their ability to win end-customer or stakeholder interest through High-End 3D Rendering approaches.

Having worked closely with variety of architects and designers over the years, I understand context, concepts, buildings, spaces, materiality and light better than most (🤞). This has helped my stakeholders identify design problems, bring ideas forward and find workarounds for their strategy. I often look to translate this extremely important asset to all the artists working at Xigma.

Me and my co-founder started very small, out of a one-room office but our creative references always sought the best out there - MIR, Floodslicer, Squint Opera, etc.. We studied them closely. Over time we grew our references to tech companies on their work methods. By focusing on lean we allowed our team of artists to produce high-quality creative work in record time. 

It is too early to say that we've come a full circle, but if I get to solve my client's purpose, then I complete that circle.

https://wellfound.com/company/zingmind-technologies,https://wellfound.com/u/reema-gupta-6,,,,Reema,Gupta,,"As a Computer Science graduate from The Ohio State University, I have always been drawn to the power of data in shaping decisions. My passion for statistics, mathematics, and machine learning led me to specialize in data science, allowing me to bridge the gap between raw data and strategic insights.

Building on this foundation, I pursued a post-graduate certification in Data Science and Machine Learning from Imarticus Learning, where I honed my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data-driven problem-solving. This knowledge, combined with my experience in data engineering, has enabled me to develop scalable data pipelines, optimize data workflows, and extract meaningful insights using Python, SQL, and Azure technologies.

While I have a strong technical foundation, my true interest lies in leveraging data to drive business and financial decision-making. Currently, I am pursuing an MBA to deepen my understanding of business strategy, financial markets, and investment analytics. My growing interest in trading and financial analysis has further reinforced my belief in the power of data-driven decision-making in today’s fast-paced economic landscape.

I thrive in roles that integrate data, business intelligence, and financial markets—whether as a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or within the investment and trading domain. My ability to translate complex data into actionable insights, combined with a strong analytical mindset, allows me to contribute meaningfully to business growth and market strategies.

Beyond my professional work, I actively share insights on data science, financial analytics, and trading strategies through blogs and discussions. I am always looking to connect with professionals who share a vision for data-driven innovation in business and finance.
