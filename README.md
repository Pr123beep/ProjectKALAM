## üöÄ What Is This Madness?

## üåü STEALTH MODE: Because Secrecy Is Sexy

Our engineers worked in an actual bunker to create this top-secret feature:

- **Neural Stealth Detection**: Algorithm so good it finds stealth companies their own founders forgot about
- **Cyberpunk Indicators**: Badges and banners straight out of a sci-fi movie
- **Exclusive Filter**: Toggle that says "show me only the mystical unicorns hiding in the shadows"
- **Futuristic Interface**: UI designed after drinking 17 Red Bulls and watching Blade Runner on repeat

## üöÄ Installation (If You're Worthy)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (time to upgrade, grandpa)
- Supabase account (free tier works, but paid makes you look cool)
- Google Gemini API key (optional, but why would you deprive yourself?)
- Coffee (mandatory)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the sacred repository
git clone https://github.com/Pr123beep/project-kalam.git

# Enter the realm of infinite possibility
cd project-kalam

# Summon the dependencies
npm install

# Create the magic spellbook (.env file)
cp .env.example .env
# Add your arcane API keys

# Unleash the kraken
npm run dev
```

### Database Enchantment

```sql
-- Copy-paste this into Supabase while chanting quietly
CREATE TABLE public.seen_profiles (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  founder_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  seen_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, founder_id)
);
-- If this works, you'll feel a slight tingling sensation
```
