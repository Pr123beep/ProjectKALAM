### 🧠 Intelligent Filtering
- Filter by college (because we all know Stanford grads need special attention)
- Search by keywords that matter to YOU
- Custom tags to organize your founder zoo

### 👁️ Visual Indicators
- Beautifully designed cards with that "I spent way too much time on CSS" look

### 🚄 Performance

- Optimized rendering that won't make your MacBook Pro sound like a jet engine

## 🛠️ Tech Stack of Champions

## 🧪 The Secret Sauce

Our proprietary "Founder Potential Algorithm" analyzes over 42 data points to predict which founders are worth your precious time. We can't tell you exactly how it works (then we'd have to kill you), but it involves:

- 🔮 Predictive analytics 
- 🤖 Machine learning
- ✨ A pinch of magic
- 🥃 Several late nights fueled by premium whiskey
